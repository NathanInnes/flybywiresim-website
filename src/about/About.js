                FlyByWire Simulations is a community-driven group created just before the release of Microsoft Flight Simulator,
                with the intent of increasing the realism of the Airbus A320NEO that is included with the sim.
                With a Discord presence more than 6,000 members strong, the team has been working non-stop to release updates and enhancements
                in an attempt to bring the A320NEO up to a study-level freeware aircraft.
